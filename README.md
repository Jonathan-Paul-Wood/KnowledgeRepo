# KNOWLEDGE REPO

There's a lot to learn in the world, and a lot of books, videos, and articles writen about it. It can be hard to sort through it all, and so here I am trying to share quality peices that I have learned a great deal from.
Shared here are a selection of articles, videos, and content. If you want a list of sources and creators that I find produce quality content, checkout [the Sources file](https://github.com/Jonathan-Paul-Wood/KnowledgeRepo/blob/master/Sources.md). Please enjoy, learn, and share.

Read something you don't see here that you think is important or valubale? Send it my way!
