<div class="blog-post__text" itemprop="description"><p>CHEN FENG was in fine spirits as his Parisian guests, midway through a banquet of lobster and candied duck, toasted his success. The chairman of HNA, a Chinese conglomerate that began as a small airline just over two decades ago, was in France for the firm’s “international week”, featuring glitzy events ranging from a golf tournament to a fashion show. The gala on June 26th coincided with Mr Chen’s turning 64. Wearing a Chinese suit, he stood on stage at the Petit Palais (pictured), as enormous sparklers blazed on a display beside him. The revellers, aided by opera singers, offered a chorus of “Happy Birthday”.</p><p>In normal times the evening would have been notable for what it revealed about a new kind of ambitious Chinese company, eager to make a global name for itself. But the circumstances were abnormal. A few days earlier word had leaked that China’s regulators wanted banks to check their loans to HNA and three other fast-growing companies. This had caused panic among holders of the firms’ shares and bonds. Analysts wondered whether the companies’ global shopping spree would screech to a halt. The good cheer displayed by Mr Chen and his colleagues seemed designed to reassure people that in HNA’s case, it would not.</p><div aria-label="Advertisement" class="fe-blogs__blog-post-inline-ad fe-blogs__mobile-ad ad-panel__container ad-panel__container--styled ad-panel__container--block" role="complementary" itemscope=""><div class="ad-panel__googlead" title="Advertisement" id="ad-panel0.3395783477047182" style="display: none;"></div></div><div class="latest-updates-panel__container latest-updates-panel__container--blog-post"><div class="latest-updates-panel__header latest-updates-panel__header--blog-post"><h2 class="latest-updates-panel__label latest-updates-panel__label--blog-post">Latest updates</h2></div><ul class="latest-updates-panel__body"><li class="latest-updates-panel-card__wrapper"><article class="latest-updates-panel__article-link"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card" href="/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/07/daily-chart"><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__body"><h3 class="latest-updates-panel-card__title">Baltimore’s murder rate is setting unwanted records</h3></div></a><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__footer"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card__subtitle" href="/blogs/graphicdetail">Graphic detail</a><time class="latest-updates-panel-card__time">20 minutes ago</time></div></article></li><li class="latest-updates-panel-card__wrapper"><article class="latest-updates-panel__article-link"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card" href="/news/europe/21724760-when-jaroslaw-kaczynski-tells-joke-you-laugh"><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__body"><h3 class="latest-updates-panel-card__title">Poland’s illiberal Law and Justice party is still on top</h3></div></a><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__footer"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card__subtitle" href="/sections/europe">Europe</a><time class="latest-updates-panel-card__time">2 hours ago</time></div></article></li><li class="latest-updates-panel-card__wrapper"><article class="latest-updates-panel__article-link"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card" href="/blogs/prospero/2017/07/21st-century-schizoid-bands"><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__body"><h3 class="latest-updates-panel-card__title">Why prog rock still deserves your time</h3></div></a><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__footer"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card__subtitle" href="/blogs/prospero">Prospero</a><time class="latest-updates-panel-card__time">4 hours ago</time></div></article></li><li class="latest-updates-panel-card__wrapper"><article class="latest-updates-panel__article-link"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card" href="/blogs/economist-explains/2017/07/economist-explains-0"><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__body"><h3 class="latest-updates-panel-card__title">How fracking leads to babies</h3></div></a><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__footer"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card__subtitle" href="/blogs/economist-explains">The Economist explains</a><time class="latest-updates-panel-card__time">12 hours ago</time></div></article></li><li class="latest-updates-panel-card__wrapper"><article class="latest-updates-panel__article-link"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card" href="/blogs/erasmus/2017/07/stuff-matters"><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__body"><h3 class="latest-updates-panel-card__title">The search for spiritual meaning in Harry Potter</h3></div></a><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__footer"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card__subtitle" href="/blogs/erasmus">Erasmus</a><time class="latest-updates-panel-card__time">a day ago</time></div></article></li><li class="latest-updates-panel-card__wrapper"><article class="latest-updates-panel__article-link"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card" href="/blogs/gametheory/2017/07/wide-open-draw"><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__body"><h3 class="latest-updates-panel-card__title">Expect the unexpected at Wimbledon this year</h3></div></a><div class="latest-updates-panel-card__footer"><a itemprop="url" class="latest-updates-panel-card__subtitle" href="/blogs/gametheory">Game theory</a><time class="latest-updates-panel-card__time">2 days ago</time></div></article></li></ul><div class="latest-updates-panel__footer latest-updates-panel__footer--blog-post"><a class="link-button link-button-standalone-read-more link-button-small" href="/latest-updates" role="button" tabindex="0">See all updates</a></div></div><p>The three other big companies named by the banking regulator were Dalian Wanda, a property developer that is building an entertainment business; Fosun, a health-to-tourism conglomerate; and Anbang, an insurer that has made a series of high-profile overseas deals. The regulator also mentioned a lesser-known entity, Zhejiang Rossoneri, an investment company that bought AC Milan, a football club.</p><p>The regulator’s instructions were simply that the banks take a closer look at loans to these companies to guard against risks. But analysts looked for possible hidden meaning. The regulator often asks banks about their exposures to various industries, but it was unusual for it to specify firms by name. Rumours spread that banks were responding by halting loans to the companies and even selling their bonds. The firms denied this was happening, which may have helped the prices of their shares and bonds to recover somewhat.</p><p>Several of the companies have connections to the ruling elite. This has led some observers to speculate that the regulator’s order might be related to factional struggles, or that it might signal an attempt by China’s president, Xi Jinping, to tighten his grip on the economy by toppling tycoons. But trying to take down so many business leaders at the same time would be an assault of unprecedented magnitude, even by Mr Xi’s standards.</p><p>There is a better explanation, namely that the action is part of a broader campaign over the past six months to clean up the financial system: a “regulatory storm”, as many have described it. Officials have worked to close loopholes, to stamp out insider trading and to cut reckless borrowing. They have targeted predatory investors, describing them as “financial crocodiles”.</p><p>How do HNA, Wanda, Fosun and Anbang fit in? They have been China’s most aggressive investors abroad. Of the $230bn of overseas deals pursued by Chinese companies since the start of 2016, these four groups account for more than $60bn, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, a data provider. This poses two risks. First, the cash exodus has piled pressure on the yuan and forced the central bank to eat into its foreignexchange reserves to support the Chinese currency. Second, much of the investment has been funded by domestic borrowing. If the overseas assets perform poorly, the companies could be left with crippling debts at home.</p><figure class="blog-post__inline-image blog-post__inline-image--generic blog-post__inline-image--slim"><img src="https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20170701_CNC175.png" alt="" title="" class=" blog-post-article-image blog-post-article-image__slim" width="608" height="625"></figure><p>Aware of these risks, the government has ratcheted up capital controls since last year, making it much harder to move cash abroad. The result has been a sharp drop in deals. Chinese firms announced about $45bn of overseas investments in the first half of 2017, down from nearly $140bn during the same period in 2016 (see chart). By demanding that banks examine their loans, regulators appear to be making capital controls more targeted and homing in on the biggest spenders.</p><p>Within ICBC, China’s biggest bank, an internal e-mail about the order does not mention the companies’ domestic operations. Rather, it focuses on what the government has termed “irrational outbound investments”, referring to highly leveraged deals, especially in industries such as property, hotels, entertainment and sport. Roughly 70% of overseas spending by HNA, Wanda, Fosun and Anbang has been in these industries.</p><p>There is, however, a clear political message in the regulator’s directive. It is that the Communist Party decides what companies can and cannot do with their cash overseas. It is sensible for regulators to be prudent about debt-fuelled deals, but their caution should apply to all sectors, not just those that are out of favour with the party. Have Chinese companies been overpaying for football clubs and hotel chains, or have they been making shrewd judgments about consumer trends? It is hard for investors to be certain. But the Chinese government has made its choice.</p><footer itemprop="publication" class="blog-post__foot-note"><!-- react-text: 1207 -->This article appeared in the <!-- /react-text --><span itemprop="articleSection">China</span><!-- react-text: 1209 --> section of the print edition under the headline <!-- /react-text --><span>"The rationality police"</span></footer></div>
