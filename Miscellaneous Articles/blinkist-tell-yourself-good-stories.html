    <h1>Persevere through tough times thanks to the stories you tell yourself.</h1>
    <div class="chapter__content"><p>Today, Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa, also known as Dr. Q, is one of the top brain surgeons in the world. He runs his own lab at America’s best hospital, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. However, his life started out in absolute poverty; as an illegal migrant farmworker, he had to demonstrate true grit, sticking with difficult work throughout his life and never giving up.</p>
<p>It sounds like everyone could benefit from some grit like that, but where does it come from?</p>
<p>Interestingly, it’s primarily a product of telling yourself optimistic stories. This is key since studies have found that we say around 300 to 1,000 words to ourselves every single minute. These words can either be positive, like “I can handle this,” or negative, like “I can’t do this.”</p>
<p>Just take an example from the military. Post 9/11, the US Navy SEALS were looking for more recruits. To ensure that a greater percentage of candidates made it through the grueling initiation ritual known as “Hell Week,” they began teaching candidates to use positive self-talk. As a result of this practice, the Hell Week pass rates rose by almost 10 percent!</p>
<p>In other words, optimism keeps people going, but true grit is more than positive thinking. It often also depends on the stories people tell themselves about the meaning of their lives.</p>
<p>A good example here is the renowned psychologist Viktor Frankl, who was imprisoned in Auschwitz in 1944. Before long, he found that some people were surviving the camp much longer than others, although they neither appeared physically stronger nor emotionally braver than those who passed away early on.</p>
<p>In observing this phenomenon, Frankl found that what was keeping these survivors going was the meaning they saw in their lives, even during times of tremendous suffering; the people who made it were those who told themselves that they had a purpose beyond themselves. Frankl himself had such a purpose, wanting to survive for his wife. He had imaginary conversations with her all the time.</p></div>
