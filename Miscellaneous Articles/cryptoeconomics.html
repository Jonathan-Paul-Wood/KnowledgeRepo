                    <p name="b18d" id="b18d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Incentives are a central component to game theory and economics in shaping human behavior toward a common good. While cryptography, or the encryption and decryption of blocks in the chain to effectively create a provable past, is universally accepted, there is still some divergence and debate when it comes to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">whether systems of incentives are actually needed </strong>to create successful cryptocurrencies or platforms.</p>
                    <p name="a472" id="a472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We cannot go on without a brief discussion of an issue underpinning the decentralized digital economy,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> the Byzantine Generals’ Problem</strong>.</p>

                    <p name="3d95" id="3d95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The glorious Byzantine army has surrounded and set siege to a castle. The generals, physically separated and commanding different units of the army, realize that that they need to decide on a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">coordinated attack</strong> or <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">coordinated retreat</strong>. It is important that the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">majority commits</strong> to one or the other, as a mistimed or halfhearted attack would mean major losses and a far worse outcome for the Byzantines.</p>
                    <p name="231a" id="231a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately, there are an unknown number of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">traitorous generals</strong> in the Byzantine ranks who would like nothing more for the campaign to end disastrously. They may send conflicting messages to different generals in an attempt to sabotage the effort. Furthermore, since messages must be relayed by messenger, it is also impossible to tell if these messages are forged or authentic.</p>
                    <p name="58cc" id="58cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The central question is this: in a system where consensus is absolutely necessary, how can a unanimous agreement be reached by good processes in the absence of trust? In other words, how can these generals overcome the traitors within and reach a coordinated, majority decision?</p>
                    <p name="9b58" id="9b58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In computer science, the capability of a system to resist failure from faulty components that prevent other critical components from reaching a necessary consensus is termed <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)</strong>. So how is this relevant to blockchain and the discussion around incentives?</p>
                    <p name="721d" id="721d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, in the absence of a protocol addressing BFT we would be completely in the dark without some centralized authority<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">. </strong>Just like the generals, Bitcoin nodes (computers sharing and propagating the blockchain) need to know what transactions are valid. For instance, like the traitorous generals and their dubious messages, people could spend bitcoins and simply tell other nodes they had never spent them. The key problem in decentralized digital currency is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">no one knows who or what to trust</strong>.</p>
                    <p name="04f3" id="04f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bitcoin’s answer to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">proof-of-work (PoW) protocol</strong> on top of the blockchain. As you’ll find plenty of discussion and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/understanding-bitcoin-transaction-verification-a-childrens-story-3d877eb2641c" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/understanding-bitcoin-transaction-verification-a-childrens-story-3d877eb2641c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">other materials</a> about PoW out there, the general idea behind this protocol is that it makes it as difficult as possible for someone to manipulate a vote due to the significant expenditure of resources (time, electricity, and processing power) required. To log a vote, each “general” would have to complete a very difficult mathematical problem that would be instantly shared with the others, who would then have to solve another difficult problem on top of it. This chain of “work” creates an ironclad transaction history while making it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for attackers to rig anything.</p>
                    <p name="3758" id="3758" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Incentives come into play to encourage participants to maintain the protocol</strong>— Bitcoin “miners”, the people who log these transactions, are incentivized with a reward of 12.5 bitcoin and transaction fees every time they apply their computing power and successfully post verified transactions onto the blockchain. In this way, they are rewarded for performing a critical service to Bitcoin, the broadcasting of blocks filled with valid, verified transactions.</p>
                    <p name="8eaf" id="8eaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the Ethereum platform, the proposed proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol goes further with a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">punishment</strong> to disincentivize malevolent activity. In PoS, validators must put up a sizeable ante of Ethereum in lieu of electricity and computing power in order to participate in the system. In the event that validators do not act to the system’s benefit, they risk losing their entire stake, or deposit.</p>
                    <p name="25c2" id="25c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So are there any <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">drawbacks to incorporating incentives</strong>? Since the protocols of the two major players in the crypto-scene have such a strong focus on cryptoeconomics, it would appear that well-designed incentive systems are critical to any blockchain tech’s success. MIT Professor Silvio Micali, a central authority in the world of cryptography, disagrees.</p>
                    <figure name="1683" id="1683" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p">
                        <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"></div>

                    <p name="a50b" id="a50b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As reported in this <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event/" data-href="http://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coindesk article</a>, Micali believes that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">incentives should be used as a last resort </strong>because they can lead to many negative externalities, and cites Bitcoin as an example. The incentives in the Bitcoin PoW system led to “industrial-scale mining pools”, where Bitcoin miners pool their resources together and split up the rewards. Observe the dominance of of these pools in the graphic below:</p>

                    <p name="2c0c" id="2c0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The advent of these massive mining pools and the consequent power bestowed on the organizations behind them really begin to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">challenge the idea of Bitcoin as a decentralized cryptocurrency </strong>while increasing the possibility of 51% attacks, which we’ll discuss later. In short, if the trend continues, we may reach a state where new bitcoin discovery is almost completely dominated by the largest miners.</p>
                    <p name="1c22" id="1c22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Micali instead proposes <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/gilad-algorand-eprint.pdf" data-href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/gilad-algorand-eprint.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Algorand</a>, an incentive-less public blockchain that attacks the Byzantine Generals’ Problem by swapping out the generals in each round through a randomization process. While I won’t discuss the mechanics in detail here, this approach avoids the amount of computation resources needed for proof-of-work and yields faster transactions as a result.</p>
                    <p name="b6b8" id="b6b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The differing approaches revolve around the interesting philosophical question about <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">whether humans are dominated by their altruistic or selfish urges </strong>as a whole. Proponents of Micali point to chronic, altruistic seeders on Bittorrent and distributed computing projects like <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/genome/using.html" data-href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/genome/using.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Genome@Home</a> as evidence that we do not always need incentives to promote altruistic behavior. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin and Vlad Zamfir of the Ethereum Foundation are firmly in the opposite camp, believing that without incentives and penalties, people can be at best apathetic (why even log on?) and at worst malicious.</p>
                    <p name="ddbf" id="ddbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the bulk of the blockchain movement embraces the idea of incentives and cryptoeconomics, it is definitely possible that Micali’s system and variants of it may take root in parallel.</p>

                    <p name="f4d7" id="f4d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">While Bitcoin’s PoW system is not perfect, the fact remains that the paradigm-shifting, cryptoeconomic principles it was built on (cryptography to secure the past, economics to ensure the future) have led to its survival and adoption for almost a decade.</p>
                    <h3 name="7a5b" id="7a5b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cryptoeconomic Assumptions of&nbsp;Behavior</h3>
                    <p name="5fbe" id="5fbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The exciting thing about cryptoeconomics is that its terminology and theory are being <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">pioneered day-by-day </strong>by blockchain developers and thought leaders. To underscore the cutting-edge innovation within this field, some of the terms associated with cryptoeconomics have less than 100 results when googled at the time of writing! While many of the ideas in this area are very theoretical, rest assured that their application will have incredible consequences on the development and adoption of blockchain technology.</p>
                    <p name="2e11" id="2e11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That said, the focus of cryptoeconomics is to<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> design robust protocols</strong> that can govern decentralized P2P systems and digital economies. In other words, cryptoeconomic concepts and techniques should be applied to shape behavior leading to desired outcomes.</p>
                    <p name="74f0" id="74f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, as a result of Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovations, Bitcoin runs on the back of a PoW incentive system that both nearly conquers the Byzantine Generals’ Problem and promotes participants’ efforts to maintain it. However, for the negative externalities Micali identified such as the push toward centralized mining pools with significant influence, the<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> PoW protocol cannot be considered cryptoeconomically efficient.</strong> While Micali points toward this as evidence that incentive systems are detrimental overall, proponents of cryptoeconomics would instead<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> suggest that the incentives or penalties do not go far enough and are not applied optimally.</strong></p>
                    <p name="b0f0" id="b0f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So through what kind of lenses should we assess a protocol? Developers at the Ethereum Foundation utilize the following security models in their analysis. These assumptions of participants’ behavior are the basis for protocol design.</p>
                    <h4 name="40e8" id="40e8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Security Models</h4>
                    <p name="2fe3" id="2fe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Honest majority model </strong>— the traditional fault-tolerance assumption that 51% or more of participants are fundamentally honest, “nice guys”. This model is largely rejected in the cryptoeconomic community and is often considered wishful thinking in a pseudonymous, decentralized digital landscape.</p>
                    <p name="6158" id="6158" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, in cryptoeconomic research, we are far more cynical. We obsess over assumptions regarding attackers — namely how <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">coordinated</strong> they are, the<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> budget</strong> they have to mount the attack, and the actual <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">cost</strong> incurred by the attack)</p>
                    <p name="75ff" id="75ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Coordinated choice model </strong>—<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>assumption that all the protocol participants are united under the same coalition or agent.</p>
                    <p name="279a" id="279a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The large Bitcoin mining pools are a good example here. Since the majority of Bitcoin hashpower is controlled by a small handful of people, collusion is quite a realistic and threatening scenario. With the rise of mining pools, a<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> 51% attack</strong>, where a single agent (or colluding agents) is able to manipulate the Bitcoin blockchain by controlling over half of the mining hashrate, is in reality quite feasible.</p>
                    <p name="f32e" id="f32e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the agent would not be able to rewrite previous transactions, steal coins from wallets, or wreak any serious havoc, he or she would be able to prevent other miners from posting blocks and “double-spend” bitcoins using both chains. Overall, the deterrent seems to be the action’s own self-defeating implications — such a collusive or massive effort would only devalue Bitcoin as a whole since participants would lose trust in the system and refuse to acknowledge transactions during this time.</p>

For flavour purposes, I’ll provide a quick and abbreviated example:</p>
                    <p name="718f" id="718f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s say in the universe of the uncoordinated choice model there exists a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">game of thrones</strong>.

                    <p name="1804" id="1804" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this game, the assumption is you would vote to sit on the Iron Throne because you want to rule the Seven Kingdoms and because sitting on a styrofoam block sucks. You also believe the majority will do this for the same reasons. Since everyone else arrives at the same conclusion you do, the majority vote will go toward sitting on the Iron Throne and everyone will collect $100.</p>
                    <p name="a921" id="a921" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, let’s say a malicious styrofoam executive is out to promote his non-biodegradable wares. In a fit of cunning, he sends everyone a conditional offer: “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Vote for the styrofoam block, and if you’re in the minority I will personally give you $110!</strong>”. Because he has a long history of always paying his debts, everyone knows that he is good for this commitment and has the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">budget </strong>to pay it.</p>

Now it makes sense for you to vote for the styrofoam throne — if you’re in the majority, you collect $100, but if you’re in the minority, even better, you’ll walk home with $110. Since everyone else again arrived at the same conclusion you did, the majority will vote for the styrofoam and the executive will allow himself a hearty chuckle, not having to pay out at all and achieving his goal at <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">zero cost</strong>. Truly, his <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">threat of benevolence</em> was his masterstroke.</p>

Substitute the iron throne for the main blockchain and the styrofoam one for the attacker’s chain and you should be able to see the vulnerability — a malicious actor incentivizing the majority of other miners to accept a deviant chain. Nonetheless, due to the extensive budget an attacker must be able to credibly reveal in order to pursue such an attack, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work protocol has persisted despite this flaw.</p>

                    <p name="3fc9" id="3fc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To assess the design of protocol capability to mitigate these existing and theoretical flaws in these security models, developers utilize two concepts:</p>
                    <p name="20d1" id="20d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first is the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">cryptoeconomic security margin</strong>, which measures the consequences (in dollars lost) of those violating a protocol guarantee. Theoretically, since the attacker can execute the P + epsilon attack at zero cost provided he or she has the budget, Bitcoin’s PoW system can be said to have a cryptoeconomic security margin of zero!</p>
                    <p name="08b8" id="08b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cryptoeconomic proof </strong>is somewhat similar; it is an assurance or message from a participant in the network that something is true. In the event that it turns out not to be true, that participant will lose a certain amount of money.</p>
                    <p name="b977" id="b977" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So let us examine the most ambitious project on blockchain tech today — the coming <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/" data-href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Casper update</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> to Ethereum</strong> that attempts to drill to the heart of these problems by switching the platform proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. While a discussion about the intricacies of Casper’s <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system</strong> is beyond the scope of this article, in short PoS seeks to provide a very large cryptoeconomic security margin by enforcing large security deposits of Ethereum in lieu of computing power in order to serve as a validator. This security deposit, or cryptoeconomic proof, acts as a potent deterrent. The message is clear — cause trouble and lose everything!</p>
                    <figure name="a2a7" id="a2a7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">

                    </figure>
                    <p name="b729" id="b729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Casper forces participants to enter a SchellingCoin Game (as outlined by our iron-styrofoam throne example) where they are forced to bet their security deposits on what the majority will be. Using the same recursive logic we discussed in the iron throne game, the majority of participants will accurately vote on which transactions are valid because each participant expects everyone else to reach the same conclusion. As such, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">PoS is resistant to the P + epsilon attack </strong>because the attacker will have to credibly show an enormous budget to subsidize the participants’ security deposits in the event that they end up voting in the minority.</p>
                    <p name="fb9a" id="fb9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the context of the security models, we can see <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Casper’s resilience in the uncoordinated choice model </strong>and from bribing attackers. Casper is also theoretically susceptible to the 51% attack stemming from the coordinated choice model. However, like Bitcoin, as Ethereum grows the costs of doing such an attack are so prohibitive as to almost completely discourage it. In Casper’s case, the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">threat of losing the stakes of all involved is an even stronger deterrent</strong>.

                    <p name="8769" id="8769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While many elements of Casper are highly theoretical and the proof-of-stake protocol itself has <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/this-statement-is-misleading-because-he-is-really-only-talking-about-what-a-51-attacker-could-65cd02a2389e" data-href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/this-statement-is-misleading-because-he-is-really-only-talking-about-what-a-51-attacker-could-65cd02a2389e" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">invoked its fair share of debate</a>, it is evident that this transition is almost entirely cryptoeconomically-minded and meant to address many of the shortcomings of the PoW system. Slowly but surely, thinkers in the blockchain space move the needle ever further in our understanding of what optimal protocol design looks like in a decentralized, digital economy.</p>
                    <p name="07fe" id="07fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some critics of blockchain technology as a whole are uncomfortable with the idea that there are so many attack vectors that are theoretically plausible today. I think it is worth noting that, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">given enough money and time, an attacker will always be able to do damage in any system</strong>. Cryptoeconomics stands as a critical bulwark that, at worst, endeavors to make these attacks as expensive, difficult, and undesirable as possible.</p>
